# W-CMS

**W** is a CMS based on my way of thinking.

It's a mix between a drive, wikipedia and a personnal blog. You can create articles very quickly and share them with other people or keep them for you and restricted people.


- The user can never see the whole map of the website : no menu (never ever)
- you can discover the website only by clicking on internal link, wiki style.
- Each page can have is own style, so you don't realise it's exactly the same website when you navigate (no graphical identity) Each page is a kind of single website on his own. (Just like a mini internet)

The code is very very light, it's a very quick and limited CMS.

The project is ispired by the *web publishing function* in *google docs* that create quick temporary web page instead of sharing a A4 page. I think very few people are using it.


There is 3 levels of privacy :

0. public
1. resctricted by reader code (read only)
2. non published : admin only
